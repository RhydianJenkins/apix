<summary><strong>How do I enable shell completion?</strong></summary>

If you haven't already, add your completion directory to `fpath`:

```sh
# in .zshrc, or wherever
fpath=($HOME/.local/zsh-completions $fpath)
compinit
```

Then generate the completion script:

```sh
# if you're using zsh...
apix completion zsh > ~/.local/zsh-completions/_apix
```

TODO Rhydian

`apix` supports `json` and `yaml` OAS, as well as remote (http) hosted and local hosted specs.

You can specifiy which spec belongs to which domain in config:

```sh
apix new myapi https://api.example.domain --oas "https://api.example.domain/myOAS.json"
# ... or
apix new myapi https://api.example.domain --oas "/local/path/to/myOAS.json"
```
