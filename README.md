## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I send a request body?</strong></summary>

`apix` aims to make use of pipelines as much as possible and takes the request body from `stdin`.

```sh
# Make a POST request to {base}/users with `my_req_body.json` as a body
cat my_req_body.json | apix post /users
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I enable shell completion?</strong></summary>

If you haven't already, add your completion directory to `fpath`:

```sh
# in .zshrc, or wherever
fpath=($HOME/.local/zsh-completions $fpath)
compinit
```

Then generate the completion script:

```sh
# if you're using zsh...
apix completion zsh > ~/.local/zsh-completions/_apix
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I get it working with OAS?</strong></summary>

`APIX` can do:

- `json` and `yaml` spec formats
- openapi versions `3.0.0` and `3.1.0`
- remote and local specs

You can specify which spec belongs to which domain in config:

```sh
apix new myapi https://api.example.com --oas "https://api.example.domain/myOAS.json"
# ... or
apix new myapi https://api.example.com --oas "/local/path/to/myOAS.yaml"
```

Assuming you've set up shell completions, you should be able to `<tab>` complete your endpoints!
